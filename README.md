# BlueTeam-RespondersUnite_SCDFXIBM
We are coders who aspire to make a difference and here is our attempt at doing so. ☺️

## Overview

We decided to tackle the first problem *Emergency Medical Services*. Specifically, we propose to enhance SCDF's myResponder application to further empower CFRs (Community First Responders). This will reduce the workload of SCDF and allow them to redirect their efforts to more urgent crises, as well as develop a more resilient and united community. 

Our application *Responders Unite* is not only a platform that seeks to **bring individual CFRs together**, but also **provides them with relevant information** that facilitates faster response, a smart application that **alerts them of potential accidents** that warrant their attention, and **eases the collaboration between CFRs and SCDF**.

To make the above a reality, we propose to
* create a forum for individuals living in the same region to share their ideas, thoughts and tips
* utilise data analytics for the detection of vulnerable groups of individuals, which can, in turn, heighten the alertness of CFRs, enabling them to respond more quickly when an accident occurs
* harness the power of machine intelligence (specifically, the artificial recurrent neural network architecture *Long short-term memory*) and internet of things for the prediction of possible accidents that might otherwise go unnoticed
* implement a chatbot that helps SCDF to gather more relevant information from CFRs in times of emergency
